    \textbf{A note to the bibliography.}
    This assignment specifically focuses on Turing patterns in \textit{networks}, with recommendation to replicate the findings presented in \cite{main_network}. However, for someone unfamiliar with Turing patterns, a few preliminary read may be necessary. Article \cite{bio_article}, targeted at biologists, offers an intuitive overview of the concept with minimal mathematical details. To delve deeper into the mathematical foundations, \cite[][\textit{Chapter 2: Spatial Pattern Formation with Reaction Diffusion Systems}]{murray} provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of Turing Patterns in a continuous medium. Another valuable resource is \cite[][\textit{Chapter 7: The Turing Model for Biological Pattern Formation}]{altbook}, which, while shorter than Murrayâ€™s chapter, still offers insightful observations.
