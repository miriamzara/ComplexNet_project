\chapter{Appendix}

This section contains an elementary introduction to reaction-diffusion systems for pattern formation. 

An activator- inhibitor system is described by the following set of equations:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} u(\mathbf{x}, t) = f(u, v) + D_{\text{act}} \nabla^2 u(\mathbf{x}, t)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} v(\mathbf{x}, t) = g(u, v) + D_{\text{inh}} \nabla^2 v(\mathbf{x}, t)
\end{equation}

where $u(\mathbf{x},\, t)$ is the local density of the activator and $v(\mathbf{x},\, t)$ is the local density of the inhibitor. $D_u$  and $D_v$ are the diffusion coefficients of the ligands or morphogens. The reactions are encoded in the functions $f(u,\,v)$ and $g(u,\,v)$. Various functional forms have been proposed for these functions. Qualitatively, those functions should describe the following facts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the activator $u$ enhances its own production and the production of the inhibitor $v$;
    \item the inhibitor $v$ suppresses the production of both the activator $u$ and itself,
\end{itemize}
Mathematically, these conditions translate to the following relations on the partial derivatives:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} > 0 \,,\quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial v} < 0 \\
         \frac{\partial g}{\partial u} > 0 \,,\quad \frac{\partial g}{\partial v} < 0 \\       
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}



Among the best known.

\begin{itemize}
    \item original Turing (1952) linear functions $f(u,\,v)$:
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{cases}
            f(u,\,v) = a_f\cdot u + b_f\cdot v + c_f \\
            g(u,\,v) = a_g\cdot u + b_g\cdot v + c_g \\            
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    where $a$ coefficients are positive, $b$ coefficients are negative and for $c$, I dont know yet.
